# OOP

---

4 Principles:

-   Encapsulation
-   Abstraction
-   Inheritance
-   Polymorphism

Override vs Overload

-   `Overload` : same name, diff params, return type...; occurs in 1 class
-   `Override` : same name, same params, same return type ...; occurs in classes. Ex: children class re-defined a method of its parent class.
